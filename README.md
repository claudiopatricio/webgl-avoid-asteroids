# Avoid Asteroids game using WebGL

![AVOID-ASTEROIDS](https://github.com/claudiopatricio/webgl-avoid-asteroids/blob/master/sample.png)

Simple 2.5D WebGL game based on Asteroids where you only have to avoid them (no shooting).

You can test the game [here](http://anjo2.com/game/).

## Coding

### Overlay

The overlay code is in the file "**css/game.css**", and includes the position for the container and the text included in the container (for example, score).

**Note**: This game was coded to play in a 4:3 resolution

### Main code

All the code you need for change the game is in the file "**css/game.js**", all other Javascript files only include libraries to help building the game. There is also some code in the file "**index.html**" required for the game to work, including text that will appear in the overlay.
